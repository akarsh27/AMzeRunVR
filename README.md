Maze Run VR Project(https://youtu.be/KFVZU82LXeE)
Project Description
• A VR maze game in which the goal for the player is to escape from a forest environment
The forest consists of three themes: summer, autumn, and winter. Each season contains
one maze
• 3D maze is very hard and could be frustrating, we have assistant mechanics in the game to make the game moderately challenging for the player but at the same time not stressful or impossible to finish
• Having an immersive forest environment
